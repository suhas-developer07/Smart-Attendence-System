# 🎓 Smart Attendance System – Server

## 📖 Overview

**Smart Attendance System** is an AI-powered solution designed to automate student attendance tracking using **facial recognition**.

Students register by submitting their facial data, which is trained by an AI model. During class sessions, a high-level camera captures live video streams, converts them into frames, and detects student presence/absence. The attendance data is then updated in the system in real time.

This repository contains the **server-side implementation** built with **Golang**, handling all business logic, APIs, and communication with the AI service.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

* **Backend (Golang)**: Handles all business logic, API endpoints, and database operations. Built using the **Echo framework**, it provides secure, high-performance REST APIs for students, faculty, subjects, and attendance management.

* **AI Integration (Python Service)**: Facial recognition and model training are handled by a separate Python service. The backend communicates seamlessly with this service for **student face registration** and **real-time attendance detection**, keeping the heavy AI computation isolated from API handling.

* **Database (PostgreSQL)**: All data—including student profiles, facial embeddings, subjects, and attendance records—is stored securely and efficiently. The backend ensures **data integrity, validation, and optimized queries**.

* **Attendance Workflow**:

  1. Students register and submit their face data.
  2. Python AI service trains the model and notifies the backend.
  3. During class, video frames are processed to detect student presence.
  4. Attendance payloads are validated by the backend and stored in the database.
